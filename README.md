# Employee Management System – Spring Boot & React

A full-stack Employee Management System built using Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend.  
The application provides RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations on employee data and integrates with a React UI.

---

## 📌 Brief Summary
- Developed a RESTful backend using Spring Boot and MySQL.
- Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for employee management.
- Integrated backend APIs with a React frontend using Axios.
- Tested all APIs using Postman.
- Designed with clean architecture using Spring Data JPA and exception handling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To build a real-world full-stack Java application.
- To understand REST API development using Spring Boot.
- To gain hands-on experience with database integration and frontend-backend communication.
- To follow industry-standard backend practices.
